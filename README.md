- we need limit capcity on 'open table' action (as the capcity in the config file), now we can assign 5 people to table where is capicity is 4 people

- closing a table does not clear the customers in it (if you close a table and reopen it you'll se twice the customers)

- fix backup and restore completely (chen)

- example 2 run yields to different outputs

- implement rule of 5

- take care of memory leaks
